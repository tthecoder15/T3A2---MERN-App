# T3A2 MERN Full Stack Application

A full stack application created by Tom Tutone and Michael Sheppard.

## Project information

This repository holds all folders, documents and source code created for a full stack MERN application _Pawfect Care_, a web application created for a hypothetical vetinary clinic.

As part of this project we completed two assignments:

### T3A2-A

Part one of the assignment, this component required us to design the data flow diagrams, application architecture diagram and wireframes for a full stack application. To access that assignment's README that describes the website's design process, click [here](https://github.com/tthecoder15/T3A2-MERN-App/tree/main/T3A2-A).

### T3A2-B

Part two of the assignment, this component required us to create the front and back end for the web application and deploy them. To access the website's source code and read about the creation process, click [here](https://github.com/tthecoder15/T3A2-MERN-App/tree/main/T3A2-B).
